# Master-Thesis
The unprecedented resolution and sensitivity of the JamesWebb Space Telescope
(JWST) in the Infrared (IR) wavelengths, has revealed a population of extremely
dusty and massive star-forming galaxies (SFGs) which remained elusive to detection
by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). These sources, called Optically Faint Galaxies
(OFGs) have been missed by studies of rest-frame UV-selected galaxies, and are
likely to contribute significantly to the cosmic star formation rate density of the
early universe. Thus studying the nature of these galaxies is crucial to understand
their role in galaxy formation and evolution.
In this work, we focus on the stellar morphology using the S´ersic light profile
of OFGs and try to understand the connection between stellar mass and size, and
dust obscuration in OFGs within the redshift range of 3 < z < 10. We have used
three large surveys in the PRIMER and CEERS fields utilising the 4.44 m JWSTNIRCam
(Near Infrared Camera) images for our analysis. We classify OFGs (and
Little Red Dots, LRDs) using colour cuts based on previous studies.
Our main results revolve around the physical properties of OFGs and how they
compare to galaxies in the parent SFG sample. We derive different scaling relations
for these sources, namely, the mass-size relation and effective stellar mass density
(ΣRe,kpc)-mass relations, with a focus on the redshift range of 3 to 4 due to the
abundance of OFGs in this range. We see that OFGs follow slightly different scaling
relations as compared to parent SFGs. Their general location on the scaling relations
is seen to be intermediate between SFGs at the same redshifts and quiescent galaxies
(QGs) seen at lower redshifts (2 < z < 3), hinting at possible signs of evolution
towards QGs. Stellar mass is found to be a clear proxy for dust attenuation. Scaled
at the same stellar mass, OFGs show over 4 times higher dust attenuation and about
2 times smaller effective radii than parent SFGs. Orientation has no correlation with
the dust attenuation of our sources. We also perform a PSF-S´ersic decomposition
and find that 52% of the LRDs come out to be “PSF-dominated” (> 50% flux
contribution from the PSF component in the light profile) while only 40% of OFGs
show the same nature.
